# How can we test strength of password?
# Over 9 characters is good - DONE
# Does it contain special characters - DONE
# Does it contain numbers - DONE
# Does it contain capitals and non caps - DONE
# Letters aren't sequential etc - DONE
# Haveibeenpwnd API??? - DONE 

#The way we can do this is assign each key feature a scale rating, eg. 7 features, 10/7 = weighting of each feature which will then do the scale of password strenght
